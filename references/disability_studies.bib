@article{bell2012mentoring,
	Annote = {Nice quote:

This article reports on a mentoring project designed for transition-age youth (ages 16--26) who are persons with legal blindness. Youth were matched with adult mentors who were also persons with blindness but who have achieved academic and career success. Results demonstrate that youth who participated in the project for 2 years had significant increases in career decision-making efficacy, positive personal hope for the future, and positive attitudes about blindness. Implications for practitioners suggest that mentoring is a valuable tool to assist youth with blindness as they prepare for the academic and work world.
