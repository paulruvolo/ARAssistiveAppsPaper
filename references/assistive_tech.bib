We also discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of electronic travel aids and propose guidelines to design and use them adequately. We provide a proposal to develop and use traveling aids. As a result, this can be a first step towards defining major aspects to develop travel aids oriented to assist mobility and orientation of blind people.},

@book{hersh2010assistive,
	Annote = {Great quote:

Independent mobility is a multifaceted topic and has been researched from
a number of different disciplinary perspectives, including that of psychology.
Combining the different basic research perspectives with that of the end-user
can contribute both to an understanding of the subject and to the development of
successful assistive technology systems to support independentmobility.However,
leaving out the end-user perspective, as has frequently happened, is likely to lead
to systems which are not taken up by end-users. This basic research can then be
used in assistive technology systems for the mobility component of travel. Embedding
assistive technology systems into the urban environment is a more recent
development but is becoming more commonplace. Such environmental assistive
technology systems facilitate access to information and can increase safety.

More great quotes:
One clear outcome was ``that the lack of visual experience
does not prevent the acquisition of spatial representation'' (Ungar,
2004). However, the studies seemed to show that blind people tend to use
body-centred (egocentric) rather than external referencing spatial strategies
to record their experiences of far-space and that external referencing strategies
can be more robust and successful for the more complicated mobility tasks in
far-spaces.

However, Clark-Carter et al. (1986) state that at least one-third of people with visual impairment or
blindness make no independent journeys outside their homes, and most of those
who do venture outside independently often travel to known destinations along
familiar routes, as explorationis considered stressful andcan lead todisorientation.},

	Abstract = {Technology abandonment may have serious repercussions for individuals with disabilities and for society. The purpose of this study was to determine how technology users decide to accept or reject assistive devices. Two hundred twenty-seven adults with various disabilities responded to a survey on device selection, acquisition, performance, and use. Results showed that 29.3% of all devices were completely abandoned. Mobility aids were more frequently abandoned than other categories of devices, and abandonment rates were highest during the first year and after 5 years of use. Four factors were significantly related to abandonment---lack of consideration of user opinion in selection, easy device procurement, poor device performance, and change in user needs or priorities. These findings suggest that technology-related policies and services need to emphasize consumer involvement and long-term needs of consumers to reduce device abandonment and enhance consumer satisfaction.},
