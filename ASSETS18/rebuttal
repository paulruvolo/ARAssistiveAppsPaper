Reviewer #1

We are grateful for the references provided by Reviewer #1, and as a result, we will soften our claims of the novelty of Clew.  Specifically, Clew is the first exploration of AR technology for the purpose of path retracing.  We will provide a discussion of the pros and cons of AR-based approaches versus step-counting approaches for path retracing.  Specifically, the pros are increased accuracy and robustness, and the primary con is the need to leave the phone's camera unoccluded (and the ergonomic challenges that this brings).

Clarifications:
(1) 23 of the 24 paths tested were successful.  Average errors were computed over successful trials.
(2) We used a blindfold to occlude the college students' vision.  The blindfold did not allow any light leakage.

Reviewer #2

We really appreciate, and will incorporate, the suggestions for additional related work (both on assistive technology and visual impairment and blindness).  Further, we will make the other changes suggested by the reviewer (e.g., streamlining the abstract, adding details about the pilot participants, etc.).

Clarifications:
(8) ViewShare relies on a CrowdSourcing model.  A sighted volunteer indicates the location of the object in one of the images captured from the user who is blind's phone.

Reviewer #3

We are very much in agreement with Reviewer #3 regarding the pitfalls of disability simulations (and the lab PI is familiar with the literature elucidating these issue).  We will add references pointing out these pitfalls in the final version.  In retrospect, we regret the usage of the term "usability testing" to describe the study we performed with the blindfolded college students.  The primary insight that can be gained from this study is that the VIO technology that powers Apple's ARKit is highly accurate and can be utilized for navigating along arbitrary complex indoor routes.  This result is not obvious given the use cases that ARKit was designed to serve.  Further, our study demonstrated that haptic feedback was intuitive to follow for the college students, which at least hints at its appropriateness for individuals who are blind (our less formalized testing with our co-designer, who is blind, was also consistent with this conclusion).  Due to these contributions, we feel that this evaluation, while not perfect, brings value to the ASSETS proceedings. 

We agree that more testing must be done on Clew and ViewShare.  Further, we agree that the only ironclad validation will be collected from in "the wild" testing by users who are B/VI.  That said, we respectfully disagree with Reviewer #3 that the lack of such testing in our submission should disqualify the paper from archival publication.  Our study is framed carefully around investigating the intersection between a well-studied area of AT (O&M for people who are B/VI) and a new mass market technology (AR).  Our study's value derives from providing a proof-of-concept that important O&M challenges (where importance is supported both by the literature and through our user-centered design process) can be addressed with AR technology.  Further, we uncovered a number of important insights through the development of these apps that are relevant to AT reseachers (e.g., the importance of holding the phone in an upright orientation).  We think it is likely that our work will inspire others to explore the usage of AR technology to develop O&M apps and provide important design guidance as they enage in this process.

General comments:

Thank you to all of the reviewers for their very helpful feedback, which will make the final version stronger.
